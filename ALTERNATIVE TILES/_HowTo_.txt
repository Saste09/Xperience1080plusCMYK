1. pick the color you want for any section on homescreen

2. rename "colour.png" to "tile-yoursection.png"
   
   e.g. i want music-section tiles to be coloured cyan on homescreen:
   	-->  rename "cyan.png" to "tile-music.png"

3. COPY your renamed tile to "//skin.xperience1080+CMYK/media/windows/home"

4. open XBMC and enjoy your new coloured Skin ;)


Name for each Section:

Home: 		tile-home.png
TVShows:	tile-tvshows.png
Music:		tile-music.png --> if you change music section 
				   "colour-addedtile.png" has to be renamed to 
				   "addedtile.png" and copied to same folder as "tile-music.png"
Applications:	tile-apps.png
Weather:	tile-weather.png

Now have fun designing your individual Xperience1080+CMYK Skin 

Cheers 
Saste
